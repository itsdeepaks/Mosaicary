# Tessli Visual Asset Manifest

Status: **canonical reference intake completed; production use remains controlled**

The canonical, user-authorized source references live under:

```text
docs/ref-img/
```

They are art-direction references, not production UI. Their hashes below make later visual comparisons reproducible without modifying their pixels.

## Hero artwork

Canonical source:

```text
docs/ref-img/tessli-hero-geometry.webp
```

- dimensions: `1200 × 800`
- format: WebP
- size: `107,546 bytes`
- SHA-256: `6512760bc1d14ad84a7a81d573abe756cdde44b42b1c80fa4182a8c3b0f1e6b3`
- purpose: canonical art-direction source
- accessibility: decorative; render with empty alt text

Approved production derivative:

```text
web/public/brand/tessli-hero-geometry.webp
```

- dimensions: `900 × 614`
- size: `61,732 bytes`
- SHA-256: `0bf8d0fcea17d10b041b2bc08422679acf4fffd7c54fc70c1b18aba9d1d85583`
- use: decorative hero art only; it must retain intrinsic dimensions and an empty alt attribute.

A separate mobile crop requires approval after the real Newsreader headline wrapping is reviewed in-browser. Do not merely shrink the desktop composition below 390px.

## Canonical desktop references

These are canonical desktop art-direction captures. They preserve composition, hierarchy, and component language but are not production UI assets.

## Asset rules

- References are art-direction and layout targets, not sources of fictional data.
- Do not use the reference screenshots inside the production Tessli application.
- `brand-preview/assets/` is a legacy static-specimen set. It may be used to run the preview but is not a canonical source, production asset, or replacement for the tracked references above.
- Production hero may be re-exported after crop approval, but preserve transparency and the warm stone/charcoal/orange palette.
- Do not apply a second heavy grain layer over the hero.
- Resource thumbnails are not included as production assets; they follow `docs/data-and-media-contract.md`.
- External site logos and images must use the documented manual preview → Open Graph → favicon → generated mark fallback chain.
